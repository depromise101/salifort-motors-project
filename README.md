# Salifort Motors: Employee Turnover Prediction & Retention Strategy

# Business Problem
The HR department at Salifort Motors collected employee satisfaction data but needed expert analysis to understand and act on it. They tasked me with identifying the factors most likely to cause employees to leave and building a predictive model to flag at-risk employees.

Employee turnover is costly due to the time and resources required for recruiting and onboarding new hires. Reducing employee turnover by understanding its drivers would greatly benefit the company.

# Project Goals
- Analyze HR employee satisfaction data to uncover key factors influencing attrition.
- Build a predictive model to classify employees at risk of leaving.
- Deliver actionable, data-driven recommendations to support HR retention initiatives.

# Skills and Tools Applied
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Predictive Modeling (scikit-learn, logistic regression, decision trees)
- Feature Importance and Interpretation
- Business Communication and Data Storytelling
